# Digits and Voice Recognizer
A Digit and Voice Recognizer by matching MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) of *template* files with the *test* files.

*To simply see the result without any notebook, you can open the HTML format in this repository.*
This notebook also contains a simple implementation of a Voice Dialler.

To run, use Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook with `librosa` installed.
You can also run it in Google Colab: (issues in reading audio files from this GitHub repo):
1. [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/edwardpassagi/voiceRecognizer/)
2. Import the audio files (from this repository) towards Google Colab's file section

Possible additions in the future:
- [x] Implement Voice Dialler complete with the setup (say the name followed by phone number)
- [ ] Use Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to automatically detect speech presence
